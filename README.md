This repository contains the source code and data generated at the SSC5888 - Autonomous Mobile Robotics (PG-CCMC) class of 2016 at the University of Sao Paulo.

The **topologicalFsm** project has been developed for investigating the global localization problem on topological maps using FSM-based testing concepts.
The *global localization problem on topological maps* has been modelled as the *current state incertainty problem* and basic sequences from the FSM-based testing domain are going to be investigated as possible solutions for this problem.
