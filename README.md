# topologicalFsm [v2.1](https://github.com/damascenodiego/topologicalFsm/releases/tag/v2.1)

This repository contains the source code, the data generated in an experiment and the technical report describing a project developed at the [**SSC5888 - Autonomous Mobile Robotics (PG-CCMC)**](http://wiki.icmc.usp.br/index.php/SSC-5888-2016(fosorio)) class of 2016 at the University of Sao Paulo.

The **topologicalFsm** project was developed to investigate the problem of robot localization in topological maps using FSM-based testing approaches.
The *localization problem in topological maps* was modelled using *mealy machines* and the *current state uncertainty*. Sequences synchronizing and homing sequences were obtained from synchronizing and homing trees and were investigated as a solutions for this problem.

In this repository, the following items are available:

  - source code of the [*topologicalFsm*](https://github.com/damascenodiego/topologicalFsm/tree/master/topologicalFsm) tool
  - The [technical report](https://github.com/damascenodiego/topologicalFsm/tree/master/report) discussing the problems and the approaches investigated
  - The [data generated](https://github.com/damascenodiego/topologicalFsm/tree/master/topologicalFsm_data) at the experiments performed.
